<p>I have been using the 1.2 branch for more than a year now, and it has been a real pleasure to see how development has moved in a very interested direction. Being in the -dev channel I have also been able to follow some of the discussions on what can stay and what can go. The result, a very clean codebase with a lot of cool features, that is very easy (and <strong>fast!</strong>) to use.</p>

<p>One of my personal favorites has to be the new ModelBehavior feature. Its incredible easy to work with, and makes its very easy to add new features to a already running project without having to hack your way into either Cake or App code :)</p>

<p>One of the few things I miss is the possibility to return a result set in Model::beforeFind &#8211; so it would be possible to create a simple cache mechanism for your query data (together with the new cache engines). Its possible, but requires a little bit of overloading of Model::find to get it to play nicely, oh well :)</p>
