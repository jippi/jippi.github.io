Finally I got the good news from my [new hosting company][1]

I can hardly wait to get it FreeBSD 7.0 installed on it and setup a nice vhost system with Lighttpd + PostgreSQL. It's gonna be awsome.
The server I'm currently using is &#8216;only' Dual core XEON w/ 3.5Gb ram, and some random SATA drives, so the improvement should be huge :D

I'm quite excited, because its going to be my first server ever without Apache and MySQL installed.

If I can find the time, I will write a guide on how I'm going to configure my server (Lighttpd, PostgreSQL, Dovecot + sendmail, quota, fast-cgi php5), it might be useful for someone ;)

Let me know if it has any interest to you guys :)
