Hello again.

I have made a small change to the feeds now. Everybody who has subscribed by Feedburner should not notice anything strange.

The reason for the change is that I want to be able to blog in Danish too once in a while, and to avoid the &#8216;danish p√∏lsesnak&#8217; for you guys who does not understand Danish, I have moved the feed location to include only posts with the &#8216;english&#8217; tag in the future <img src='http://www.cakephp.nu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

[English posts only][1] (Hopefully your using this one right now <img src='http://www.cakephp.nu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> ), [Danish posts only][2] and [Danish+English posts][3]
