Finally I got the good news from my [new hosting company][1]

I can hardly wait to get it FreeBSD 7.0 installed on it and setup a nice vhost system with Lighttpd + PostgreSQL. It&#8217;s gonna be awsome.  
The server I&#8217;m currently using is &#8216;only&#8217; Dual core XEON w/ 3.5Gb ram, and some random SATA drives, so the improvement should be huge <img src='http://www.cakephp.nu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> 

I&#8217;m quite excited, because its going to be my first server ever without Apache and MySQL installed. Or well, atleast until some stupid customer or what not ([Biesbjerg][2]?) demands it <img src='http://www.cakephp.nu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

If I can find the time, I will write a guide on how I&#8217;m going to configure my server (Lighttpd, PostgreSQL, Dovecot + sendmail, quota, fast-cgi php5), it might be useful for someone <img src='http://www.cakephp.nu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

Let me know if it has any interest to you guys <img src='http://www.cakephp.nu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
