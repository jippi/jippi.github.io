Hello,
just wanted to post a quick apoligy <img src='http://www.cakephp.nu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

Sorry that I havent created the weekly summaries for almost 1.5 week now. The reason is that I have begun on a new job, and its consuming quick alot of time and energy <img src='http://www.cakephp.nu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> Lot of new systems to learn (They dont use Cake&#8230;. yet, booooh!)

I have the second edition 80% done, just need to clean it up and proof read it a few times <img src='http://www.cakephp.nu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> Should be done before this weekend
