The slides for my 3 talks at CakeFest 2013 are now online

## [Scaling CakePHP](http://friendsofcake.com/presentations/cakefest-2013/scaling-cakephp)

A talk on scaling CakePHP. It got surprisingly little to do with CakePHP, and so much more to do with PHP and the underlying infrastructure for your servers.

## [Crud - Application Development on steroids](http://friendsofcake.com/crud/presentations/jippi-cakefest-2013/)

Talk on [CRUD](https://github.com/friendsofcake/crud), describing the pro and cons of bake, scaffolding and CRUD, and how awesome CRUD really is.

## [Friends Of Cake](http://friendsofcake.com/presentations/cakefest-2013/friends-of-cake/)

I presented the vision for [Friends Of Cake](http://friendsofcake.com/) and what we want to achieve with the project and how it can benefit the CakePHP community.
