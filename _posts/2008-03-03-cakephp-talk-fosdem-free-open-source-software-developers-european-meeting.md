A small note, gwoo&#8217;s talk from [FOSDM 2008][1] has been made [public avilable here][2] together with [his slides][3].

Its actually a quite good presentation, too bad he ran out of time in the end <img src='http://www.cakephp.nu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />
