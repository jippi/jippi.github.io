<p>Hello,</p>

<p>My name is Christian Winther, Jippi amongst friends and I live in Valby, Denmark. I&#8217;m 25 years old and currently working as full time TYPO3 developer at <a href='http://www.mocsystems.com' target='_blank' title='TYPO3 lÃ¸sninger'>MOC Systems</a>.</p>

<p>I started this blog in January 2008, about a year after I began to use CakePHP. The reason for my late entry on the blog sphere is that I really havent had the time, been too busy with my <a href='http://www.bonitet.dk' target='_blank'>development firm Bonitet</a> that create portal solutions for some fairly big companis in Denmark.</p>

<p>You can contact me the following ways:</p>
