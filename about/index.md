Hello,

My name is Christian Winther, Jippi amongst friends and I live in Valby, Denmark. I&#8217;m 25 years old and currently working as full time TYPO3 developer at <a title="TYPO3 lÃ¸sninger" target="_blank" href="http://www.mocsystems.com">MOC Systems</a>. 

I started this blog in January 2008, about a year after I began to use CakePHP. The reason for my late entry on the blog sphere is that I really havent had the time, been too busy with my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bonitet.dk">development firm Bonitet</a> that create portal solutions for some fairly big companis in Denmark.

You can contact me the following ways:
